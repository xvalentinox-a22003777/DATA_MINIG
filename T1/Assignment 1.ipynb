    "### Question 1 (5,0 values) Spike Triggered Average\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the world of neuroscience! <br>\n",
    "In this exercise you will have the opportunity to be gently introduced to the magnificent world of how your brain  executes what you think! \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"brain.jpg\" alt=\"brain\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The brain is perhaps our most complex vital living organ, meaning that the multitude of years of research so far is still not sufficient to understand how such an organ behaves.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically, the brain is formed by a particular form of cells that are called <strong>neurons</strong>. Such neurons are electrically excitable cells that communicate with one another via specialized connections named <strong>synapses</strong>. These connections allow the transmission of chemical and electrical signals across neurons. In very high-level terms, such a process gives birth to the human thought, giving us the possibility to carry out our ordinary life tasks and habits, such as talking with friends, eating, drinking, studying, and so on and so forth.\n",
    "Moreover, it is possible to say that communication across two neurons is experienced when we observe a <strong>spike</strong>, which is solicited by an electrical <strong>stimulus</strong> (through time). <br> \n",
    "As an example, imagine you are on your sofa watching your favorite movie: each photogram of the video you see from your eyes will be converted into a sequence of electrical signals, which we previously defined as <strong>stimulus</strong> (this is the scientific term). Then the stimulus flows in the network of your neurons, potentially activating their effects on your behavior. Specifically, if you watch a love scene, some neurons of the brain may <strong>spike</strong> (actually they are activated), potentially making you feel pleased and emotional. On the contrary, if you watch a violent scene, some other neurons may spike, potentially making you feel sad and uncomfortable. This is an abstract example talking about emotions, but bear in mind that examples of this kind are extendable to more practical activities such as the ones mentioned in the paragraph above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, in this exercise, you will analyze a stimulus and consequantly how it affects the spikes of a single neuron. <strong>Data is randomly generated</strong>, but it simulates perfectly the setting depicted above. In the end, you will compute the <strong>Spike-Triggered Average</strong> (STA), which, given a fixed time window, approximates the stimulus's behavior before a spike occurs. This is a time-wise average, meaning that, given many <strong>fixed-in-length time-sequences</strong> (same milliseconds long in this case) of the same stimulus, we average the sequences at their values at each millisecond step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some clarifications: \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided with two time-series, one with the stimulus and the other one with the spikes. The latter series maps to the former, of course.\n",
    "Stimulus varies in time, specifically milliseconds (ms), meaning that each element in the stimulus is an electrical signal at a single millisecond. Whereas, the spikes are in binary form: 1 if a spike occurred, 0 if a spike did not occur at that specific milliseconds. "
